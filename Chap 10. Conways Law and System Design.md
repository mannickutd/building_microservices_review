## Chapter 10 Conway's Law and System Design

* "Any organisation that designs a system will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organisation's communication structure."
* Single teams should have full ownership of a lifecycle of a service (design, deployment and operating). A small focused geolocated team can have frequent, fine grained communication to match the service boundary in which it is responsible for.
* Feature teams, is that a small team drives the development of a set of features, implementing all functionality required even if it cuts across components/service boundaries.
* Microservices are services modeled after a business domain, not a technical one. If a team owns any given service similarly aligned along a business domain, it is much more likely that the team will be able to retain a customer focus, and see more of the feature development through because it has a holistic understanding and ownership of all the technology associated with a service.

### Second law of consulting

* "No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem."
